    <h1>The Shoeb Goldberg</h1>
    <h2> An engenious entirely-mechanical invention to tie your shoes completely hands free! 
        It works via a clever ratchet and pawl system that contains two seperate release mechanisms for each pawl. 
        It is powered by a lever that you press down with your foot. the lever returns for another cycle with springs. 
        the lever turns the ratchet wheel, which is attached to the same square axle as the spool. the spool turns and draws in the laces. 
        When the laces need to be loosened, you use your foot to push the lever the other way to release both pawls and let the ratchet wheel and spool spin freely. 
        To learn more about the details, you can take a look at the PDF writeup listed below. It contains everything from the theoretical work all the way to the final testing. 
        A full year of work contained in one paper!</h2>
